Welcome to Fit Buddy.

This app is a meet up for athletes  The app focuses on the fact that finding people to workout with on a busyschedule can be difficult and that more structuresd groups often meet at difficult or inconvenient times.  Not too mention finding people who want to do workouts with different levels of diificulty.  

There are 3 models: users, events, and RSVP (which functions as the join table).

The app is intuitive and does not need a nav bar for its current functionality.

Fit buddy is set up so that anyone can view a list of workouts from most currently crerated on.  In order to join or add a workout you must sign up and sign in.  Then you can join a workout.  It also displays the number of who have rsvp'd to a certain workout.  

Additional functionality includes a map link to see the location of the workout via an address.
